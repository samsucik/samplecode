###chocolate.cpp

Console application which solves the following problem: Given a chocolate consisting of *R* rows and *C* columns of squares,
each square having certain richness (e.g. number of air bubbles in it), find the smallest total richness of a chocolate part
after cutting the chocolate into *A x B* parts by *A* horizontal cuts and *B* vertical cuts (all cuts are made along the squares' edges).
Time complexity: *O(RC log M)*, where *M* is the average richness of a single square.
Memory complexity: *O(R x C)*
